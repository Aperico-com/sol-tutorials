# Hello

The tutorials I've published here were initially made for myself. I made them to help me remember the tasks I performed to set up and maintain my Solana devnet validator. Then I figured they could also benefit others. Please note that I am a Linux novice, so I really have no idea what I’m talking about in most of these tutorials. I will not be held responsible for the shipwreck your system may or may not be after following any of the instructions here. Still, I have tried my best to provide correct, understandable and user friendly information.

Most of the information here is compiled from the official [Solana docs](https://docs.solana.com/) and the replies I’ve gotten from helpful people in the [Solana Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/pquxPsq). Go to those places to resolve any issues you may have.
