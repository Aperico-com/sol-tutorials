# Hello

My pseudonym is Andrebo, and I'm a blockoholic. I was never into blockchain before I found [Solana](https://solana.com/). Solana is a blockchain that solves some of the biggest challenges for blockchain to become widely adapted: transaction speed and throughput. Solana supports sub second transactions, and tens of thousands transactions per second. No other blockchain technology is even remotely close to doing this. Considering the amount of use cases Solana opens up for, especially in finance, my inner tech geek and finance amateur decided I should be part of the journey.

The tutorials I've published here were initially made for myself. I made them to help me remember the tasks I performed to set up and maintain my Solana devnet validator. Then I figured they could also benefit others. Please note that I am a Linux novice, so I really have no idea what I’m talking about in most of these tutorials. I will not be held responsible for the shipwreck your system may or may not be after following any of the instructions here. Still, I have tried my best to provide correct, understandable and user friendly information.

Most of the information here is compiled from the official [Solana docs](https://docs.solana.com/) and the replies I’ve gotten from helpful people in the [Solana Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/pquxPsq). Go to those places to resolve any issues you may have.
